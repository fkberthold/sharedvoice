## Documentation

sharedvoice's documentation lives in `docs/` and is published
at the project's GitHub Pages site (configured in
`.github/workflows/docs.yml`).

The docs are organised in four Diataxis quadrants:

- **Tutorials** — guided walkthroughs for new users.
- **How-to guides** — task-oriented recipes for the already-competent.
- **Reference** — the austere catalogue of surfaces, signatures, and
  behaviours.
- **Explanation** — the wider, reflective view of *why* the project
  is shaped the way it is.

Build locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdocs serve
```

Before publishing, replace every `DOCS-SCAFFOLD-FIXME` sentinel left
by the docs scaffold — `grep -r DOCS-SCAFFOLD-FIXME docs/` lists
them, and `mkdocs build --strict` will refuse to build until every
one is gone.
